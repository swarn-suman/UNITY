Project Overview
This project provides an interactive visualization tool for understanding 3D coordinate systems, focusing on cylindrical and spherical geometries. Developed using Unity, the tool allows users to dynamically explore how changing parameters such as radius, angles, and height impact the structure and position of 3D shapes. By enabling real-time manipulation and immediate visual feedback, it is designed as an educational resource to bridge the gap between theoretical geometry concepts and hands-on learning.

Features
Interactive Parameter Control: Users can adjust the radius, angles, and height for shapes, which instantly updates the 3D visualization.
Coordinate Systems Display: Displays points in multiple coordinate systems—rectangular (Cartesian), spherical, and cylindrical—helping users to understand the relationship between these systems.
Shape Options: Offers visualization for both cylinder and sphere shapes, each allowing for independent parameter adjustments.
Real-Time Feedback: Parameters adjusted on an interactive sidebar immediately reflect on the 3D model, enhancing the learning experience.

Development Environment
Unity Game Engine: Used for creating the 3D environment, rendering shapes, and developing interactivity.
Programming Languages: C# for Unity scripting, with knowledge of mathematics and 3D transformations applied.

How to Use
Select a Shape: Choose either a cylinder or sphere for visualization.
Adjust Parameters: Use the sidebar to dynamically change the parameters (e.g., radius, angles, height).
Observe Coordinates: As you adjust parameters, watch how the coordinates and shapes update instantly in the display.
Experiment with Systems: Switch between coordinate systems (rectangular, cylindrical, spherical) to see transformations.

Installation
Download the APK using the link provided and install it on any Android device. The tool is optimized for mobile use, allowing for on-the-go 3D exploration.

Future Enhancements
Expanded Shape Library: Additional 3D shapes, such as cones and tori.
Complex Transformations: More advanced parameter controls to explore further transformations.
Additional Coordinate Systems: Potential expansion to include polar coordinates and hybrid systems.
